    <h4 class="page-subtitle">About LifeLog</h4>
    <p>
      LifeLog aims to be a project tracking and accountability tool. It's intended
      to help you keep track of your own work and share the status of your projects
      with others. This is done via the creation of project pages. Project pages
      contain all relevant information about a project as well as house a space
      for project updates and user comments. <br/>
      As a project owner, you can keep yourself or your relevant audience up to date on steps taken toward the
      completion of a project. Project viewers are encouraged to comment and question
      the work, so that owners may give clarification and spark discussions.<br/>
      Above, you can find currently active or popular projects, which can give you a feel
      for ways to take advantange of LifeLog!
